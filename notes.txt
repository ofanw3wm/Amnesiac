I swiped this for the guymager gui 
https://www.pinguin.lu/xmount utlity i swiped from Dev-zero 
Version bumped xmount 0.6.x is now autobuilding for Gentoo / Sabayon Entropy bin repo's .... 

it alows for High quality forensic disc captures and conversions to 
EnCase , and other common types used by law enforment or Foresics pros..


Hopefully the pentoo team can find use for these...

the bumped ebuilds knowing my luck wont initiall pass qa and since 
api version has been bumped it's be my luck that the ebuild will snafu just like gentoo-science try to give them a 
github gui bump and snap....

http://scripts4cf.sourceforge.net/also might be useful to package......
